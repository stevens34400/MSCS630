# Multithreaded Word Frequency Counter (Multiprocessing Version)

## Lab Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **multiprocessing** in Python to perform concurrent processing on a large text file. The program:

- Accepts a text file and the number of segments (`N`) as input.
- Splits the file into `N` segments (by word count).
- Launches one **process per segment** to count word frequencies.
- Displays a **progress bar** while processing.
- Consolidates all word frequencies and saves the result to `output.txt`.
